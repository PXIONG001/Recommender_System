# Recommender System
A Recommender system is an application within machine learning that utilizes mathematical algorithms and statistics to find recommendations based on a users data.

## Background of doing this project
During my senior year in college, I had a computer science class that was required of me to take called capstone in which we needed to find a specific topic in a computer science field. Here, I was assigned with a group, and we chose the field of artificial intelligence in which I chose recommender systems. Now, our professor had to cut off some parts of our learning experience due to less timing with our schedule. To add some context, I was having classes during the coronavirus pandemic, and my school (CSBSJU) switched to the block schedule which caused less time for our class to learn more. Anyways, one essential learning part within our capstone that was cut out was our tech demo. I never got the chance to do it which made me feel unfulfilled. This repository will be my version of a recommneder system which won't be perfect, but I will improve upon it. Feel free to read my paper on recommender systems in which I explain the background, technical analysis, and my thoughts on it.
